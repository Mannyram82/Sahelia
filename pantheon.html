                    <p class="description">A force of inevitable and transformative power, Kothar embodies both ruin and renewal. He represents destruction as a necessary force for change. His influence is felt in the violent devastation of war and the quiet, inexorable decay of nature and life. His followers view destruction not as an end, but as part of a greater cycle—whether through the crumbling of empires, the death of living things, or the disintegration of the physical world. Kothar’s power is one of both chaos and order, teaching that only through breakdown can new growth emerge.

The timing of revelation is as crucial as the secret itself—hidden truths, shared at the right moment, can reshape events. Through Illyandra, the unseen is honored, with balance between concealment and revelation guiding the world. The hidden holds as much value as the visible, and shadows often conceal the greatest truths.
