                        <div class="cult-description">Malachi was once a devoted servant of Eramé, the goddess of creation, renowned for shaping the world and inspiring awe among mortals. With pale skin and silver hair, he had an ethereal beauty. Under her guidance, he crafted magnificent landscapes, but pride soon clouded his judgment. Believing he could rival her power, he challenged her authority and claimed his contributions were equal. Ignoring her warnings, Malachi rejected her wisdom and was cast down from the Celestial Realm. Now, as ruler of the Regal Reaches, his domain reflects his ambition, filled with grand structures of his former glory. After his fall, yellow horns and delicate, insect-like wings adorned him. Though his charm attracts followers, his actions are driven by an insatiable need for validation as he seeks to reclaim the respect lost in the eyes of the goddess he betrayed.

                        <div class="cult-description">Ishtar was once a devoted servant of Garrick, the god of travels and journeys, celebrated for her ability to inspire mortals to seek adventure and embrace their wanderlust. However, the spark of inspiration she ignited soon morphed into a seductive force, leading her to embrace desire and ultimately transforming her into the embodiment of lust. After her fall, she became the ruler of the Province of Passion, where every glance and whisper evokes longing. Now adorned with scaled wings tipped with claws and pink horns that crown her head, Ishtar’s presence is an irresistible invitation to indulge in pleasure. Her shimmering pink garments enhance her allure, and her laughter fills the air like a siren’s call, ensnaring the hearts of those who hear it and guiding them to explore their own desires. While she revels in her seductive power, echoes of her past remind her of the innocent inspiration she once provided before succumbing to the intoxicating allure of lust.

However, he became consumed by his own fury, allowing rage to eclipse his discipline until it transformed him into the embodiment of unbridled wrath. With his fall, he became a terrifying figure—a being of primal rage ruling over the Anger Archipelago, a shattered domain of volcanic isles and storm-lashed coasts. Now adorned with massive, blood-red wings that stretch like those of a dragon, Lucius towers over his realm, embodying a relentless storm of hatred and vengeance. His crimson horns curl outward in twisting S-shapes, symbolizing the consuming fury that defines his every thought and action. His voice booms like thunder, igniting tempers and driving mortals and fiends alike to violent frenzy. Lucius no longer lives by the purpose he once knew; instead, he is driven by an insatiable lust for battle and destruction, taking twisted pleasure in the rage of others.

However, in her pursuit of perfection and desire for what others possessed, she succumbed to corruption, transforming into the embodiment of envy. Now, she reigns as one of the co-rulers of the Covetous Coves, a treacherous realm where longing and desire manifest in chaotic waves. Seraphina’s striking appearance reflects her twisted nature; her bird-like wings shimmer in shades of green, reminiscent of a dark forest. Horns adorned with a similar hue protrude from her temples, serving as a constant reminder of the jealousy that courses through her veins. With a voice as smooth as silk but laced with bitterness, she whispers insidious thoughts to those who cross her path, feeding their discontent and sowing seeds of rivalry. Driven by a relentless hunger for what she cannot have, Seraphina thrives in the shadows of others’ accomplishments, her heart a tempest of envy that fuels her ambitions and desires.

Ravenna’s appearance is both alluring and unsettling; her skin glimmers with a golden sheen, and her long hair cascades like liquid gold. Towering above others, she has large, twisted horns spiraling from her head, a stark reminder of her fall. Her expansive orangey-gold wings are adorned with ornate intricacies. Ravenna's sharp eyes gleam with fervor, betraying her ambition. She speaks with a silken voice, honeyed yet steeped in avarice, enticing others into her schemes while weaving webs of deception. Driven by an unquenchable desire for wealth and control, her heart is a cavern of greed that consumes all who cross her path.
